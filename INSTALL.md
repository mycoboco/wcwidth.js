How to build and install wcwidth.js
===================================

This package does not provide an automated way to build or install the library
except using [`npm`](https://npmjs.org/package/wcwidth.js) because `wcwidth.js`
is intended to runs on top of [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org). If you have
`node.js` in your system,

    npm install wcwidth.js

brings the latest version of `wcwidth.js` and installs it with its all
depending packages.
